Portfolio of Piotr Murawski. Mainly for recruitment purposes. Contact: piotr.murawski.94@gmail.com

Tower Defense - A project that I started about 1.5 - 2 years ago. The goal was to see if I would be able to create a TD game from scratch without any help. Looking through the prism of time, I am more than sure that I would do some things differently, but this is one of the projects that I really like and still I am thinking of working on it again (
Especially when I have time to pay off my technical debt and refactor the code :) )

Hex Game - A project that I started recently. Inspired by the Neuroshima Hex board game, I decided to try my hand at creating a board game with very similar mechanics
however, placed in a completely different style. The leitmotif is to be elves, orcs, dwarves, etc. fantasy in full swing.
